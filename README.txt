This is a PIC microcontroller project for my team's passive solar model house project. This was an introductory engineering course, so we were given a skeleton program to flesh out along the way to the final product of the project. Somehow I found myself programming the whole thing and in charge of the breadboard assembly/maintenance. This was done in PBASIC, of course there were other files, but those were from other sources provided to us to use.

The circuit was connected to several temperature sensors, the program obtained the temperature data from each sensor and also controlled when the LED lights in the house would light based on calculated values for sunset (and sunrise). An LCD screen was attached to the breadboard to display temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius. The program controlled a servo to turn when the temperatures exceeded a certain value. We used our heads and found a way to create a vent on the top of the house and a drawstring. to connect the servo and vent together.
